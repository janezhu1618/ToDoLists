# ToDoLists
An app that enables users to create to-do lists and save items under them.  

# Introduction
Being forgetful is an issue that most people have.  People often don't remember what they are supposed to do, what groceries to get, or what errands to run when they are free.  ToDoLists is an app designed to help users stay organized in their everyday lives.  This versatile app enables users to add a category and add items under the category like to-do tasks.  It can be used to help people keep track of what to buy on their next grocery run, what movie to watch next, or what tasks they must finish before the end of the day.
